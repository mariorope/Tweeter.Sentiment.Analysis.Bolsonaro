# Tweeter.Sentiment.Analysis.Bolsonaro
The objective of this project was to capture data from the social network Twitter related to the Bolsonaro theme, and perform sentiment analysis. After collecting and processing the data, word cloud visualizations were generated, as well as the calculation of the sentiment score accompanied by a boxplot and histogram to facilitate the interpretation of the results. It is worth mentioning that this project had as its main objective the practice of the Tweeter data collection and analysis tools, and therefore, it is not interested in promoting or redeeming the President of the Republic Jair Bolsonaro, but only doing a sentiment analysis of the last 10,000 tweets written in English.
